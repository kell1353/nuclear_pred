# Overview
This program provides numerical and analytical solutions for the energies at a few different potentials. The infinite well, harmonic 
oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potential. It writes these solutions into files for each potential for a few different states.
 
This program calculates numerically eigenenergies and eigen-wavefunctions for the Woods Saxon potential and provides output for analysis.


# Testing
Once you have typed the file name, it then will perform calculation, print the analytical and numerical energies comparison and write the results of the program into 
three probability density files and a file with the Woods-Saxon energy results.

The probability density files should have 4 columns. 'x', 'ground state', '1st excited', '2nd excited'.

- x: This column will contain the sample points in the box.
- ground state: This column will contain the ground state probability densities.
- 1st excited: This column will contain the 1st excited probability densities.
- 2nd excited: This column will contain the 2nd excited probability densities.

The other file should have 4 columns. 'radius', 'ground state', '1st excited', '2nd excited'.

- radius: radius of the Woods Saxon potential
- ground state: This column will contain the ground state probability densities.
- 1st excited: This column will contain the 1st excited probability densities.
- 2nd excited: This column will contain the 2nd excited probability densities.
